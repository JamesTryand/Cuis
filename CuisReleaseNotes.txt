    Improvements to MessageTally, ProcessBrowser, CPUWatcher.

    Underscore in identifiers enabled by default.

    Many bugfixes, some of them from Squeak.


New in Cuis 4.0
-------------------
It is important to note that almost all the work done in this release was supported by Bernhard Pieber, mostly by financial support, but also by providing ideas, requirements and productive discussion. Thanks Bernhard!

	* Package Support. Cuis 4.0 has a package implementation based on PackageInfo. Can be used with a Git repository (like GitHub) for package versioning. More at www.jvuletich.org/...XXXXX "CodeManagementInCuis4" and "CuisAndGitHub"

	* New handling of ChangeSets. The idea is to have only one "live" change set that automatically captures all changes done to the Cuis Core image. Changes to Packages go to separate ChangeSets.

	* UCompletion. A new implementation of Autocompletion for Smalltalk code. Activates with ctrl-space. Usually gives the selector desired as the first option. Some features are:
		- Sorts by last definition of selector (Methods recently saved go first),
		- Sorts appropriately all selectors matching entered prefix (no hardcoded limits, like 40 selectors matching 2 letters).
		- Restricts suggestions if receiver is Global, a Constant or a pseudo-variable.
		- Doesn't have an "expanded mode". Always shows relevant suggestions.
		- Not restricted to a set of previously selected packages. All the methods in the system are accounted for.
		- Very fast, thanks to an optimized Trie implementation.
		- Compact code. Relies on services by Trie (for storing and querying selectors) and Shout (for parsing incomplete methods).
		- Helps make Shout faster, by providing super fast queries of selector prefixes.
		- Can be used for other applications besides Smalltalk code. Currently used for an English glossary for StyledTextEditor.

	* Trie. Cuis 4.- includes a very optimized implementation of a Trie. Tries are dictionaries where keys are Strings. Lookups are extremely fast. Search for entries marching a prefix are extremely fast (O(1) regardless of the size of the collection). Addition and removals are quite fast too. Used for UCompletion, holding 11,000 selectors. Also used for an English spell checker (in the StyledTextEditor project) holding 166,000 words. In both cases use of memory is quite reasonable (3 and 5.4 bytes per character in average) and query speed is extremely fast.

	* Multiple level undo / redo in all text and code editors.

	* ClickNHalf+Drag to select words. TripleClick or DoubleClickNHalf+Drag to select paragraphs. Like most modern text editors and wordprocessors do.

	* Multiple text selection (with control+mouse). Like most modern text editors and wordprocessors do.

	* Lf. The newline character is no longer Character cr (ASCII code 13), but Character lf (ASCII code 10). This is the standard in Mac and Unix platforms, and the required convention for GitHub. All the code in the image has been converted.

	* cmd-w closes window below mouse pointer. cmd-< y cmd-> cycle through windows.

	* New "PostIt" like HoverHelp morphs.

	* Simplification / Redesign: Scrolling in Morphic (TransformMorph gone, etc).

	* Deep cleanup in Paragraph and paragraph display services in Canvas and DisplayScanner (now MorphicScanner).

	* MouseClickState refactor, to ease new gestures (ClickNHalf+Drag, DoubleClickNHalf+Drag, TripleClick).

	* Killed AbstractEvent hierarchy. Unified event subscribing, triggering and handling everywhere in Cuis.

	* More TextMorph cleanup.

	* Numberic enhancements done by nice and jmv, both on Squeak and Cuis.

	* Many minor enhancements, cleanups and bugfixes.

	* Updates to Squeak: Numerics, Network, and many others.


New in Cuis 3.3
-------------------
	* New nice Icon set from Tango (Casey)
		- Most menu options have now a nice icon

	* ContentPack - A clean solution for a problem Squeak had for over a decade! (Casey)

		- Allows import / export to enable use of use existing stuff and external tools
		- Does not depend on external files for image update
		- Updates done with code (enabling change sets of Monticello packages)
		- Avoids cruft accumulation, code for resources is removed after update

	* Taskbar for better access to minimized windows (Casey)

	* Multiple selection on text morphs (Thanks Bernhard Pieber and Software Generation!)
		- Use ctrl + mouse for multiple selection
		- Do 'Preferences disable: #commandClickOpensHalo' to enable the standard Mac gesture for multi-selection
		- Enhanced senders view: all occurrences of sent message are highlighted

	* Cosmetic tweaks in menus and Themes

	* NewTranscript fixes and enhancements (right click menu)

	* Morphic Windows hierarchy, builds and handles UI and menus; handles keystrokes

		- Use of ReferenceStream for copying object graphs such as Morphs

	* Editor tweaks and enhancements. Code simplification, removed several ivars

	* New image shrinking tools: #reduceCuis for building reduced images

	* Support for gigabyte changes and sources files

	* Many minor Morphic fixes

	* BlockClosure>>#isClean, BlockClosure serialization (for clean blocks), enabling use of ReferenceStream for copying objects

New in Cuis 3.1
-------------------
    * Super fast Morphic world display.

          o     Simpler code.

    * New Layout engine.
          o     New layout adjusters and window resizers.
          o     Allows adding / removing morphs without leaving "holes".
          o     Orders of magnitude simpler. Can be understood by humans. Removed all traces of the old code.

    * Cleaner look for Default theme. Nicer buttons, menus and halos. Faster world redraw allows for full-window resize.

    * Morphic buttons simplification: reduced 5 morphic button classes into just one.

    * New Transcript
          o     Fast (Calls return quickly)
          o     Fast (Updates are immediate)
          o     Thread safe
          o     Can log to file in addition to Display

          o     Optional morphic window for seamless integration in Morphic
          o     UI framework agnostic. Can be used to debug Morphic, even with the morphic window open, without crashing the image!

New in Cuis 2.0
-------------------
Full Closure Support. With full closure support, you can finally use recursive blocks like here:
	fac := [ :n | n > 1 ifTrue:  n * (fac value: n-1)] ifFalse: [1]].
	fac value: 5. "120"
and close over temps correctly, such as here:
	(1 to: 10) do: [ :i | WorldState addDeferredUIMessage: [ Transcript cr; show: i ]].
This is nother closures example
	fib := [ :n | n < 2 ifTrue: [1] ifFalse: [(fib value: n-1) + (fib value: n-2)]].
	fib value: 10. "89"
Cuis 2.0 is ready to run on the Cog VM (when available) and it requires a closures-enabled VM.
